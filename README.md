# 📄 PDF Merger — A Tiny Tool With a Big Job

This little Java Swing app was built to solve a simple everyday problem: too many PDF files scattered everywhere. Instead of juggling them one by one, this tool lets you gather them all, line them up in the order you want, and merge them into a single clean document. No complicated menus, no confusing options — just a friendly sidebar, a tidy list, and a merge button that does exactly what it says.

You can add as many PDFs as you like, remove the ones you don’t need, and shuffle them around using Move Up and Move Down until everything looks just right. Drag & drop is supported too, because sometimes clicking through folders feels like a chore. Each file shows up with a neat little icon and its filename (no long messy paths), keeping the interface clean and easy on the eyes. A small status panel at the bottom of the sidebar keeps you updated on what’s happening, so you always know what the app is doing.

Behind the scenes, the merging magic is handled by Apache PDFBox, while the UI stays lightweight and simple thanks to classic Swing. The whole project is intentionally straightforward — perfect for learning how layouts, events, and components work together without drowning in complexity.
